# MP3-Interpreter

This project aims to create an MP3 file converter that can convert an MP3 file into usable data for a beat-matching music rhythm game. The program aims to convert the data within the MP3 file into button presses for the five buttons on Harmonix guitar-style controllers, the program will parse the data, remove any outliers, and place the keys into button presses within that button's range.
